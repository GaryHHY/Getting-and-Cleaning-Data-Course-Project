# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The usage of run_analysis.R script is to transform the Samsung data to tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The script takes input data from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and output a text file *tidy_data_set.txt*.

View codebook.md for details of *tidy_data_set.txt*
